				"ProfessorSnail_Hint_824": "Before Snail got stuck in that cave, he was exploring the gully nearby. His notes describe the stones there as being full of fossils. I'd recommend breaking them open to look for bones.",

				"ProfessorSnail_Hint_820": "Golden coconuts are a mysterious thing... not even I fully understand them. It would be wise to look inside any you find.",
