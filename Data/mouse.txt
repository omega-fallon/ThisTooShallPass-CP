(I'm not going to comment on this particular thing anymore after this, but just wanted to say that when things look bleak for you, you get so focused on all the shit that's gone wrong, all the shit that could go wrong, all the ways you and everything suck, that it's just a black hole. And the longer you spend in it, the more you are convinced it's only happening to you and everyone else is only living their lives through the happy accident of not having to be you, not having to deal with the shit you have to deal with.

And you just get so warped you can't even see the shit anyone else is dealing with either, all the time. They only succeed because they're not you, which means you don't have a chance, and they don't understand. Just one foot in front of the other for as long as you can, whatever minimum effort you can bring yourself to do despite not feeling like it and even if it feels like a lie not closing yourself off to the possibility of actual growth, to give it room to happen on fucking accident if nothing else.

If you don't feel like learning this or working on that, you absolutely don't have to. You don't owe shit to anybody, including explanations. But I feel like you owe it to yourself to just do it or not  do it without the endless inward monologue of all the reasons you cannot and will never succeed. Smash that shit with some hobnailed boots man, it's not doing you any favors.

This was probably an unwelcome interjection, and it's certainly only barely on topic if it is at all, but still.)
